# bluetooth_test_2

a simple bluetooth chat application (with bad UI pls don't judge) taking inspiration from [google's offical bluetooth repo](https://github.com/android/connectivity-samples/tree/main/BluetoothChat), 
and this [amazing repo](https://github.com/mitchtabian/Sending-and-Receiving-Data-with-Bluetooth) as well, and of course the [official docs](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/bluetooth)
for future use: [bluetooth low energy](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/bluetooth/ble-overview) i.e when battery of device is low.
